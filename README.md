# Kairrer-ranc
A high-level programming language with low-level abstractions.

In fact, Kairrer itself is not a programming language, it is an interface or API for working on something that requires modification in the process.
The programming language itself is called Kairrer-ranc. The compiler for Linux is written in C++. This allows you to use it
to perform tasks at a level that any other programming language can perform.
Our goals also include creating prototypes of the Kairrer interpreter in languages â€‹â€‹such as Python, JavaScript, Java, Dart. 
This will allow you to import it as a library and freely use it in your projects.
